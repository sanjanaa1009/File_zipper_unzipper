# Custom File Zipper and Unzipper with Huffman Coding Algorithm

This project demonstrates a custom file zipper and unzipper that uses Huffman compression to compress files and bundle them into a single zip file, as well as decompress and unzip them back to their original form. The project is implemented in Java and does not rely on any external zip libraries.

## Features

- Read files from specified paths.
- Compress files using Huffman compression.
- Bundle compressed files into a single zip file with custom headers.
- Decompress and unzip files from the custom zip format back to their original state.

## Project Structure

- `Main.java`: The main entry point for the application.
- `Zipper.java`: Handles file reading, compression, zipping, decompression, and unzipping.
- `HuffmanCompression.java`: Implements the Huffman compression and decompression algorithms (implementation placeholder in this example).

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- A Java IDE or text editor (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, VSCode)

## Getting Started
